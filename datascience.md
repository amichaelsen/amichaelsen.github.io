While at Berkeley, I discovered an interest in the world data science and took advantage of courses and resources at Berkeley and beyond. I got my start taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning [Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera, and from there have taken Data Science, Statistics, and Computer Science courses at Berkeley. I am currently completing the Graduate Certificate in [Applied Data Science](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/data-science-certificate) through UC Berkeley's School of Information. This spring I am also participating in the [Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/)'s [Boot Camp](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/code) for PhD students interested in pursuing Data Science roles in Industry. 

My first data science project was creating a sport fencing data set by scraping competition data from the FIE website. I have posted the dataset on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amichaelsen/fie-fencing-womens-foil-data) and my GitHub repo for generating the data is [here](https://github.com/amichaelsen/fie-fencing-dataset). Some initial analyses of the data are also on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amichaelsen/fie-fencing-womens-foil-data/code) and GitHub [here](https://github.com/amichaelsen/fencing-data-analysis).
