Hi, my name is Anya Michaelsen. I am a third year graduate student in mathematics at UC Berkeley advised by [Melanie Wood](http://people.math.harvard.edu/~mmwood/).
For undergrad I attended Williams College where I completed my [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07675) with Susan Loepp.
My research interests are in (algebraic) number theory.
