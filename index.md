Hi, my name is Anya Michaelsen. I am a third year graduate student in mathematics at UC Berkeley advised by [Melanie Wood](http://people.math.harvard.edu/~mmwood/).
For undergrad I attended Williams College where I completed my [thesis](/research) with Susan Loepp.
My research interests are in (algebraic) number theory and arithmetic statistics. For more information on my mathematical research, qualifying exam preparation/advice, or math related articles see my [math page](/math).

Beyond mathematics I am also interested in data science and currently pursuing a Graduate Certificate in [Applied Data Science](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/data-science-certificate) through UC Berkeley's School of Information. You can learn more about my background and projects [here](/datascience).

When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking (the photos are from some of my adventures), climbing, skiing, and more recently running. When I'm not in the great outdoors I love hanging out at coffee shops, board games and word games, cooking, and sometimes trying my hand at baking.
