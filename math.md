### Nullstellenfont

{% include figure.html image="/assets/math/nullstellenfont_ANYA.png"  width="600" height="800" %}

For MATH 487: Algebraic Geometry at Williams College, taught by Ralph Morrison, Ben Logsdon and I created a font
out of affine varieties, called Nullstellenfont.
Our [article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10724117.2020.1714365?fbclid=IwAR0Avop2MSE8z0_c5NYh2qT4WVkVOG-gnbsU2Z4WwCt4F8OZNrRt4WNwmxE&journalCode=umho20)
 about it appeared in the April 2020
edition of [Math Horizons](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/math-horizons) and will be featured in [The Best Writing on Mathematics](https://press.princeton.edu/series/the-best-writing-on-mathematics).  We also created code to convert a string of text to an affine variety and
compute the defining equation. You can see an example [here](/assets/anya-nullstellenfont.pdf). You can
also [make your own text](https://sites.google.com/williams.edu/nullstellenfont/) or check out the [code](https://github.com/bclogsdon/nullstellenfont).



### Creating Posters

After presenting posters at numerous conferences and science fairs, I wrote an
[article](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202002/rnoti-p189.pdf) for the February 2020 edition
of the AMS Notices [Early Career](https://www.ams.org/cgi-bin/notices/amsnotices.pl?article_id=career&article_type=gallery&gallery_type=career)
section about creating (mathematical) posters.
