My mathematical research interests are in algebraic number theory and arithmetic statistics. In Fall 2021 I took and passed my Qualifying Exam at Berkeley (major topics: Algebraic Number Theory and Probablity, minor topic: Complex Analysis). To help future students, I am maintaining a page with resources I created or collected during this process. My study materials, advice, other resources, and the full transcript from my exam can be found [here](/quals).

A list of my publications can be found [here](/research). In addition I've written the following articles 

### Nullstellenfont

For MATH 487: Algebraic Geometry at Williams College, taught by [Ralph Morrison](https://sites.williams.edu/10rem/), Ben Logsdon and I created a font
out of affine varieties, called Nullstellenfont.
Our [article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10724117.2020.1714365?fbclid=IwAR0Avop2MSE8z0_c5NYh2qT4WVkVOG-gnbsU2Z4WwCt4F8OZNrRt4WNwmxE&journalCode=umho20)
 about it appeared in the April 2020
edition of [Math Horizons](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/math-horizons) and was later featured in [The Best Writing on Mathematics](https://press.princeton.edu/series/the-best-writing-on-mathematics) [2021 Edition](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691225708/the-best-writing-on-mathematics-2021).  We also created code to convert a string of text to an affine variety and
compute the defining equation. You can see an example [here](/assets/anya-nullstellenfont.pdf). You can
also [make your own text](https://sites.google.com/williams.edu/nullstellenfont/) or check out the [code](https://github.com/bclogsdon/nullstellenfont).



### Creating Posters

After presenting posters at numerous conferences and science fairs, I wrote an
[article](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202002/rnoti-p189.pdf) for the February 2020 edition
of the AMS Notices [Early Career](https://www.ams.org/cgi-bin/notices/amsnotices.pl?article_id=career&article_type=gallery&gallery_type=career)
section about creating (mathematical) posters.
