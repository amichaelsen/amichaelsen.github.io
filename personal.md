I enjoy hiking/backpacking, climbing, skiing, and more recently running. When I'm not in the great outdoors I love hanging out at coffee shops, board games and word games, cooking, and sometimes trying my hand at baking. 

Recently I've been enjoying the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), as well as many of the variants that have spun off from it. In particular:

**[Quordle](https://www.quordle.com/#/):** solve four simultaneous games of Wordle

**[Semantle](https://semantle.novalis.org/):** determine a secret word based on semantic meaning using word2vec encoding  

**[Redactle](https://www.redactle.com/):** guess a Wikipedia page based on a redacted version
